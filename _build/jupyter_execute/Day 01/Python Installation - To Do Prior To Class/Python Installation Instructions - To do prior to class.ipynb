    "\n",
    "If you Google \"most popular coding languages'' or \"which programming language is best for getting a job'', you will see that Python is near the top of the list.  In addition, Python has become the language of choice for AI, machine learning, and data science. We won't be doing intense computer programming; if you are interested in programming in Python, you should take SI286: Programming for Everyone next semester. We'll mostly be using Python for data manipulation and analysis.  In order to begin working with Python, we need to install the required software."

    "In order to minimize the potential for issues when installing the required Python software, please go to the USNA Software Center to make sure your computer is current with respect to required software updates (Software Center has been having problems lately, and if this is your situation, just skip to the next section.) To get to the Software Center, first click on the Windows icon on the bottom left corner of your PC screen. Then type software. That should bring up a link to the software center program at USNA. Click on the Software Center link.  Once Software Center is open, go to the Updates tab and click Install All at the top right corner (see the image below) to install all required updates.  Once the updates have finished, restart your computer.\n",
