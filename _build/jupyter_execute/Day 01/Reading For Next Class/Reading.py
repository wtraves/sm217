# # Reading for Next Class: Introduction to Data Science and Percentiles
# 
# Please read [Chapter 1](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/01/what-is-data-science.html) of the textbook, Computational and Inferential Thinking, by  Ani Adhikari, John DeNero, and David Wagner. This is a nice introduction to data science using Python. As well, read about percentiles in [Chapter 13.1](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/13/1/Percentiles.html) of the same book. You should complete reading quiz 01 prior to coming to our next class (see the [course website](https://sites.google.com/usna.edu/data-science-for-decision-make/home) for links to the reading quizzes).
