# Please read [Chapter 1](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/01/what-is-data-science.html) of the textbook, Computational and Inferential Thinking, by  Ani Adhikari, John DeNero, and David Wagner. This is a nice introduction to data science using Python. As well, read about percentiles in [Chapter 13.1](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/13/1/Percentiles.html) of the same book. You should complete reading quiz 01 prior to coming to our next class.
