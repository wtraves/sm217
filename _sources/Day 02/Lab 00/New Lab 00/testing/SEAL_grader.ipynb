    "## SEAL GRADER: An automated grading system\n",

    "STEP A: \n",
    "To use the autograder, first make a folder and store the following files in that folder:   \n",
    "(1) This file  \n",
    "(2) The ...SOLUTIONS.ipynb file to the assignment  \n",
    "(3) The ...LASTNAME(S).ipynb file to the assignment  \n",
    "(4) The downloaded student ....ipynb files from Blackboard  \n",
    "(5) A blank Excel file called grading_data.xlsx  \n",
    "(6) An Excel file containing the word Alphas in cell A1 and the alphas of midshipmen in your class in cells A2 and below. It is best if this file also contains the first names of the midshipmen in column C (starting in C2). Or you can enter MIDN Jones in that cell if you address MIDN Felix Jones as MIDN Jones. CAREFUL: The autograder will eventually overwrite any material in column B next to the alphas.   \n",
    "\n",
    "STEP B: \n",
    "Open both files (5) and (6) and run the cell below. \n",
    "\n",
    "The autograder will populate the grading_data.xlsx file with various data. Most of this includes material that is already\n",
    "graded but it will also include questions that need to be manually graded. These tend to be text answers that can't be \n",
    "easily graded by the computer or pictures (e.g. a histogram). You'll need to complete the rows in the spreadsheet labeled\n",
    "q...:credit by assigning a grade to each of these questions. When you first look at the spreadsheet after allowing the \n",
    "autograder to complete writing to the file, type CTRL-A (to select all) and then hit the button for WRAP TEXT (roughly about\n",
    "40% of the way to the right, on the Home ribbon.) Save the completed Excel file. \n",
    "\n",
    "STEP C: \n",
    "Replace ... in the next cell with your Excel file's name (file 6, above) where you want the grades to be written. Run\n",
    "the cell and wait for your grades to appear in the proper location. "

In this case, we sandwich a code cell between the question cell and the answer cell with the tag special-code. That cell should contain the code *global credit* and the credit variable should be assigned in the cell. You can use cell\\_num to refer to the current cell (the cell tagged qxx) and cell\\_num-1 to refer to the previous cell, etc. In accessing portions of the cells, you'll probably want to know how the cell's code appears when it is being read by the seal_grader program.
