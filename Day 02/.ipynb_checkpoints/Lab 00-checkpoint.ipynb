    "\n",
    "In today's class we'll work on our first lab, Lab 00. You can find the Jupyter notebook containing the lab on our [course website](https://sites.google.com/usna.edu/data-science-for-decision-make/home). The lab introduces notebooks, basic arithmetic, syntax errors, use of functions (particularly the percentile function), and concludes with an examination of data about income inequality in America. \n",
